This project aims to enable the user to work with audio and data files. Our main goal is to provide
tools for signal treatment. The code covers Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Wavelet Transform and two
more modules: one for merging two audios and another for noise reduce. More information about how it
works is presented in the file 'example.ipynb', in the documents folder and some usage examples are
shown in the 'presentation.ipynb' file.

We would like to thank professor Luiz Eleno, Trevizan and Samuel MÃ¡laga for all the suport.
